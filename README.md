# urban-octo-couscous

This is test task for DevOps position.

The goal is to
* fix compile errors
* implement collectProcStat() function
* write code to deploy resulting binary to N-number of Linux amd64 virtual machines

  You can use ansible, python or go-lang to do so!


Optionaly setup prometheus to scrape metrics and grafana to show them (containers are ok!)
